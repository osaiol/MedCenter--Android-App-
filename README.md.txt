About This Product
The Medical Center Application is designed to be used by medical professionals as well as patients in a Medical Centre. Medical Centre Application (hereafter referred to as MCA) is designed to be simple to use, and easy to navigate to find the information or functionality you are looking for. To help with this we have created this user manual to help navigate MCA for the first time.
